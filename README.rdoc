= Tit4Tat

My attempt to create an genetic-algorithm for playing
TicTacToe.

== Conclusion

It's an interesting expirement. For some reason my 
players don't seem to evolve. Perhaps it's becuase
I need years fo runtime to get positive results, or
perhaps my design doesn't create the proper dynamic,
e.g. it's too easy for bad players to get reintroduced
into the gene pool.
